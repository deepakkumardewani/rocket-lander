#### Step 12: Update HUD for Environment Context

- Enhanced `src/components/HUD.vue` to display environment information:
  - Added an environment indicator in the top-left corner that shows the current environment ('Space' or 'Sea')
  - Created a computed `environmentDisplay` property to properly capitalize the environment name
  - Implemented a `platformName` computed property that returns 'Boat' or 'Platform' based on the current environment
  - Updated all platform-related text in the UI to use the dynamic platformName
  - Added more detailed crash message that mentions the current platform type (e.g., "Land safely on the Boat")
  - Applied consistent styling to the environment indicator with the game state display

#### Step 13: Add Boat Texture

- Added boat texture support in `src/utils/assetLoader.ts`:
  - Created `loadBoatTexture` method to load a wooden texture from `/src/assets/textures/boat_wood.png`
  - Implemented proper error handling with fallback to a procedurally generated brown texture if the image fails to load
  - Configured the texture with repeat settings for proper appearance on the boat surface
  - Updated `GameCanvas.vue` to load and pass the boat texture to the BoatPlatform constructor
  - Modified the BoatPlatform to prioritize using the boat-specific texture over the generic platform textures

#### Step 14: Add Sea Environment Sound

- Added sea environment audio:
  - Updated `loadGameAssets` in `GameCanvas.vue` to conditionally load sea waves audio when in the sea environment
  - Added sea waves sound file to assets folder at `/src/assets/audio/sea_waves.mp3`
  - Implemented automatic playback of the ambient sea waves sound at reduced volume (0.3) when in the sea environment
  - Added proper cleanup in the onUnmounted hook to stop the sea waves sound when component is unmounted
  - Used looping audio for continuous ambient sea sound while in the environment

These implementations provide a realistic sea environment with appropriate lighting, textures, audio, and UI context. The environment now has distinct visual and audio characteristics that differentiate it from the space environment while maintaining consistent game mechanics.

### Sea Environment Improvements - Phase 1 (Steps 1-4)

✅ **Completed**

#### Step 1: Upgrade Sea Surface Geometry

- Updated `src/game/SeaSurface.ts` to improve sea surface geometry:
  - Increased plane geometry segments from 32x32 to 128x128 for significantly finer wave detail
  - Maintained the base size of 100x100 units
  - Added mesh scaling (1.5x) to ensure the sea spans the entire visible area
  - Optimized the geometry initialization for better performance
  - Added detailed comments explaining the changes

#### Step 2: Enhance Wave Animation in Vertex Shader

- Enhanced the vertex shader in `SeaSurface.ts` with sophisticated wave animation:
  - Added two additional sine waves with different amplitudes (0.1 and 0.05) and frequencies (0.15 and 0.08)
  - Implemented a directional component for waves to simulate wind-driven motion
  - Added time-based offsets with different speeds for each wave component
  - Implemented proper normal recalculation for accurate lighting
  - Combined waves with carefully balanced weights for natural-looking results
  - Added slope calculation for better visual fidelity

#### Step 3: Improve Fragment Shader for Realism

- Upgraded the fragment shader in `SeaSurface.ts` to achieve more realistic water appearance:
  - Added fresnel effect for angle-dependent reflection with bias and power parameters
  - Implemented subtle foam highlights on wave crests
  - Changed base color to a deeper blue-green (0x1e8090) for more ocean-like appearance
  - Added specular highlights using Blinn-Phong lighting model
  - Added dynamic light reflection calculations based on view direction
  - Improved edge fading and transparency effects
  - Implemented color mixing based on wave height for depth perception

#### Step 4: Add Normal Mapping for Wave Detail

- Added normal mapping support for enhanced wave detail:
  - Added `loadSeaNormalTexture` method to `src/utils/assetLoader.ts`
  - Implemented fallback normal map generation using canvas gradients and noise
  - Modified fragment shader to apply normal mapping with proper transformations
  - Added TBN matrix calculation for accurate normal mapping
  - Created proper texture tiling (4x4) for the normal map
  - Updated `GameCanvas.vue` to load and pass the normal map to the sea surface
  - Implemented proper texture memory management and cleanup

These improvements significantly enhance the visual realism of the sea environment, transforming the basic sea surface into a dynamic ocean with layered waves, reflections, and proper lighting interaction. The enhanced vertex and fragment shaders create a much more compelling and immersive experience while maintaining good performance.

## Feature 2: Sea Environment Enhancement

### Step 1-4: Basic Sea Surface Implementation

✅ **Completed**

### Step 5: Enable Environment Reflection

✅ **Completed**

- Added `cubeCamera` and `cubeRenderTarget` properties to the `SceneManager` class
- Implemented `createCubeCamera` method in `SceneManager` to create a cube camera positioned at y=5 above the sea surface
- Added `updateCubeCamera` method to render the environment from the cube camera's perspective before the main camera renders
- Implemented proper cleanup with `disposeCubeCamera` method
- Modified `SeaSurface` class to accept a `reflectionTexture` parameter (cube render target)
- Updated sea surface shaders to include reflection mapping:
  - Added world position calculation in vertex shader for correct reflection mapping
  - Implemented reflection vector calculation in fragment shader
  - Added reflection intensity control with custom uniform
  - Blended reflection with base color based on fresnel effect for realistic angle-dependent reflections
