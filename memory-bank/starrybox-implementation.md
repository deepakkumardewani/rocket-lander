# Dynamic Starry Skybox Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Create a Dynamic Star Field

### Step 1: Create a StarField Class ✅

- Create a new file `src/game/StarField.ts` to manage dynamic stars
- Implement a class that creates a particle system specifically for stars
- Define parameters for star count, size range, color variation, and movement speed
- Test: Verify the class initializes without errors by adding console logging

### Step 2: Generate Random Star Positions ✅

- Implement a method to generate stars in a spherical distribution around the camera
- Use THREE.BufferGeometry with Float32Array for positions and colors
- Create stars with random positions using spherical coordinates
- Ensure stars are far enough away (e.g., radius of 80-100 units)
- Test: Log the generated star count and verify it matches the expected number

### Step 3: Add Star Movement Logic ✅

- Implement an update method that slightly shifts star positions each frame
- Add parameters for movement direction and speed
- Include options for different movement patterns (radial, directional, twinkling)
- Create time-based movement to ensure consistent speed across devices
- Test: Verify stars move at the expected rate by measuring position changes over time

### Step 4: Create Star Materials ✅

- Create a custom point material for stars using THREE.PointsMaterial
- Configure proper transparency, size attenuation, and blending
- Add texture support for more realistic star appearance
- Test: Confirm material properties are set correctly by logging their values

### Step 5: Integrate StarField with SceneManager ✅

- Update `src/game/sceneManager.ts` to create and manage the star field
- Add the star field to the scene
- Call the update method in the animation loop
- Implement proper disposal in the cleanup method
- Test: Verify the star field appears in the scene by checking child count

## Phase 2: Enhance Star Visuals

### Step 6: Create Star Textures ✅

- Add a small star texture to `/src/assets/textures/`
- Update the AssetLoader to load the star texture
- Apply the texture to the star material for better appearance
- Test: Confirm texture loads correctly and applies to stars

### Step 7: Implement Star Twinkling ✅

- Add a time-based opacity variation to create twinkling effect
- Create a method to randomly select stars for twinkling
- Implement smooth transitions between opacity levels
- Test: Verify opacity values change for selected stars over time

### Step 8: Add Color Variation to Stars ✅

- Create a color array with common star colors (blue-white, yellow, orange, red)
- Assign colors based on a distribution that matches real star populations
- Add subtle color pulsing to some stars
- Test: Confirm distribution of colors matches expected percentages

### Step 9: Add Depth and Parallax Effect ✅

- Create multiple star layers at different distances
- Make closer stars move faster than distant ones when camera rotates
- Implement a subtle automatic camera rotation for constant parallax effect
- Test: Verify stars at different distances move at different rates

## Phase 3: Add Celestial Objects ✅

### Step 10: Add Distant Planets/Moons ✅

- Create a method to add a few larger spheres representing distant planets
- Use simplified geometry with basic textures
- Position them at strategic points in the skybox
- Test: Confirm planets appear at expected locations and with correct scale

### Step 11: Implement Planet Glow Effect ✅

- Add a glow shader for planets using THREE.ShaderMaterial
- Create parameters to control glow color, intensity, and size
- Ensure the glow effect works with the lighting system
- Test: Verify glow renders correctly by checking with and without the effect

### Step 12: Add Occasional Shooting Stars ✅

- Create a method to spawn temporary shooting star particles
- Implement trajectory calculation for natural-looking paths
- Add a trail effect using particle decay
- Set random timing for shooting star appearances
- Test: Trigger manual shooting stars and verify they appear and disappear correctly

## Phase 4: Optimization and Integration

### Step 13: Implement Performance Optimization

- Add distance-based level of detail for stars
- Create a culling system to only render stars in view
- Implement instancing for better performance with many stars
- Test: Measure frame rate before and after optimization with high star counts

### Step 14: Add User Controls for Sky Effects

- Update gameStore to include skybox settings (star density, movement speed)
- Create a settings panel in the HUD for adjusting sky effects
- Implement real-time updates when settings change
- Test: Verify changing settings immediately affects the star field appearance

### Step 15: Integrate with Game Time and Environment

- Link star movement to game time progression
- Make sky appearance change based on game progress (e.g., more intense during higher levels)
- Add subtle color shifts to entire sky based on game state
- Test: Verify sky appearance changes appropriately when game state changes

### Step 16: Create Skybox Transition Effects

- Implement fade transitions between skybox states
- Add ability to smoothly change entire sky appearance
- Create special effects for level transitions
- Test: Trigger transitions manually and verify smooth visual changes

## Phase 5: Polish and Extras ✅

### Step 17: Add Nebula or Space Dust ✅

- Create a subtle volumetric effect for distant nebulae
- Use layered transparent planes with noise textures
- Add very slow movement to create a living universe feeling
- Test: Verify nebula renders with proper transparency and doesn't affect performance

### Step 18: Implement Aurora-like Effects ✅

- Add shader-based aurora effects near the horizon
- Create parameters for aurora color, intensity, and movement
- Link aurora appearance to special game events
- Test: Trigger aurora effects and verify they render correctly

### Step 19: Add Lens Flare for Bright Stars/Sun ✅

- Implement a lens flare effect for the brightest star or sun
- Create a system that positions flare based on camera view
- Make flare intensity change based on viewing angle
- Test: Verify flare appears and changes appropriately as camera moves

### Step 20: Final Integration and Testing ✅

- Ensure all skybox elements work together harmoniously
- Verify that visual effects don't impact game performance
- Balance visual appeal with distraction potential for gameplay
