### Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoaded, hasError).
- Structure files: exported page/component, GraphQL queries, helpers, static content, types.
- Use tabs for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings (except to avoid escaping)
- Omit semicolons (unless required for disambiguation)
- Eliminate unused variables
- Add space after keywords
- Add space before function declaration parentheses
- Always use strict equality (===) instead of loose equality (==)
- Space infix operators
- Add space after commas
- Keep else statements on the same line as closing curly braces
- Use curly braces for multi-line if statements
- Always handle error parameters in callbacks
- Limit line length to 80 characters
- Use trailing commas in multiline object/array literals
