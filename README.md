# 🚀 Rocket Lander

A challenging 3D rocket landing game built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Three.js. Master the art of precision landing as you guide your rocket through various environments and increasingly difficult challenges.

## 🎮 Game Description

Rocket Lander puts you in control of a rocket that must safely land on designated platforms. Navigate through dynamic environments including space stations and ocean platforms while managing fuel consumption, wind resistance, and realistic physics. Each level presents unique challenges with varying platform sizes, environmental conditions, and obstacles.

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Lighting**: Realistic lighting and shadows

### 🏆 Game Features

- **Rocket Customization**: Multiple rocket designs and textures
- **Leaderboard**: Track your best scores and compete with others
- **Online Presence**: See other players online

### 🛠️ Technical Features

- **3D Graphics**: Built with Three.js for smooth 3D rendering
- **Physics Engine**: Cannon.js for realistic physics simulation
- **State Management**: Pinia for game state management
- **Real-time**: Firebase integration for online features
- **Modern Stack**: Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript

## 🎮 How to Play

### Controls

- **←/→**: Directional thrust
- **Spacebar**: Main engine thrust (upward)
- **Mouse**: Camera control and zoom
- **R**: Reset camera position
- **ESC**: Pause/Menu

### Objective

1. Launch your rocket from the starting position
2. Navigate to the landing platform using thrust controls
3. Land gently on the platform without crashing
4. Manage your fuel efficiently - you have limited supply!
5. Progress through increasingly difficult levels

### Tips

- **Gentle Landings**: Land with low velocity to avoid crashes
- **Fuel Conservation**: Use thrust sparingly to maximize your chances
- **Wind Awareness**: Account for wind effects in higher levels
- **Platform Positioning**: Some platforms move or are positioned off-center
